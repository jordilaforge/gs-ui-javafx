GraphStream
===========

Welcome to GraphStream, and thank you for your download, we hope you will find it useful and practical.

We are always interested by suggestions on how to make the library more developer friendly, see the [website](http://graphstream-project.org) for more information.

UI
--

This module is intended to provide several alternative graph "renderers" to be used with the GraphStream Viewer. It contains actually one renderer, the javafx version of the basic swing renderer.

This renderer supports almost all of the CSS properties defined in the [GraphStream CSS Reference](http://graphstream-project.org/doc/Tutorials/GraphStream-CSS-Reference_1.0/), however it is still a work in progress. This viewer is intended only at 2D visualization actually.

We are interested in any suggestion to improve this renderer, and your use cases could be of great help for us in developing this project. If you like and use this project, this could be a good contribution.

Building and jars
-----------------
The project need gs-core for compile.
The release comes with a pre-packaged jar file named gs-ui-javafx.jar that contains the GraphStream classes related to this UI. To start using GraphStream, simply put this jar file and the gs-core.jar in your class path.
